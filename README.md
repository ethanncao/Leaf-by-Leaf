# Leaf-by-Leaf
A personal health dashboard website that tracks your daily goals/habits in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle!

# CORE FEATURES

# Tasks
- Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
    Work/Study: Deadlines, assignments, projects.
    Health: Exercise routines, meal tracking.
    Personal: Reading, hobbies, self-care.
    A calendar view to display tasks for the day/week.

# Healthy Lifestyle Tracking
- Sleep Tracking:
    Users input daily sleep hours.
    Receive feedback if they're meeting recommended sleep durations.
- Exercise Tracking:
    Users log workouts (type, duration, intensity).
    Encouragement to meet weekly activity goals.

# Growth Visualization
- A digital plant grows based on user progress:
    Completing tasks or maintaining a healthy routine grows leaves, flowers, or fruits.
    Missing tasks or unhealthy patterns may slow growth or wither the plant.

# Progress and Analytics Page
- A dashboard shows:
    Task completion rate (e.g., percentage of completed tasks).
    Health stats (e.g., weekly sleep average, exercise frequency).
    Plant growth stages as a visual motivator.

# TECHNICAL STACK

# Frontend
Framework: React.js (dynamic and interactive user interface).
Styling: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for clean and responsive design.
Visualization: Use Canvas API or libraries like Three.js or D3.js for plant growth animation.

# Backend
Server: Node.js with Express for a robust REST API.
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth2 for secure login.
Health Tracking Logic:
Write algorithms to calculate daily/weekly progress.

# Database
Task and User Data: PostgreSQL (relational database for structured data like tasks, user info).
Health Tracking: MongoDB or Firebase (good for semi-structured, flexible health-related data).

# User Journey
1. Signup and Login
    New users can create an account via email or social media.
    Onboarding introduces features and plant-growing goals.
2. Adding Tasks
    Users input tasks:
    Title, description, category (work, health, personal).
    Due date and reminders.
    Tasks are displayed in a calendar or to-do list.
3. Healthy Habit Tracking
    Users log:
    Sleep: Hours slept each night.
    Exercise: Type of workout and duration.
    Optional integrations:
    Sync with wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Health).
4. Plant Growth
    Visual feedback:
    Completing tasks = plant grows leaves.
    Meeting health goals = flowers bloom or fruits grow.
    Consistent progress = plant evolves into a new stage (e.g., sprout → tree).
    Notifications encourage users to stay on track:
    “Your plant is thriving! Keep up the great work!”

# Gamification Ideas
Streaks: Daily streaks boost growth rate (e.g., log sleep 7 days in a row = rapid growth).
Achievements: Unlock new plant types or pots for milestones.
Leaderboard: Compare growth with friends (optional social feature).

# Plant Growth Visualization
How It Could Work
- Stages of Growth:
    Seed → Sprout → Small Plant → Large Plant → Flowering Plant → Fruit-bearing Plant.
Growth Logic: ?
- Points system:
    Completing a task: +5 points.
    Exercising: +10 points.
    Logging sleep (7+ hours): +5 points.
    Every 50 points = next growth stage.

# Visual Library:
Use SVGs or 3D models for plant stages.
Dynamic rendering using Canvas API, react-three-fiber, or Lottie animations.

# UI/UX Features
- Homepage with a dashboard that shows:
    Today’s tasks.
    Progress bars for sleep, exercise, and tasks.
    The user’s growing plant in the center as a motivational focus.
- Task Manager
    A minimal to-do list with drag-and-drop functionality for prioritizing tasks.
- Health Tracker
    A weekly tracker that shows:
    Sleep hours (bar chart).
    Exercise frequency (calendar view).
- Plant Screen
    Full-screen view of the user’s plant.
    Information on growth milestones and what they’ve achieved to grow the plant.

# Stretch Features
- Social Features:
    Allow users to share their plant growth or challenge friends.
- Gamification Add-ons:
    Daily/weekly challenges like “Complete 5 tasks today to unlock a rare flower.”
- AI Suggestions:
    Use AI to suggest tasks or habits based on user patterns.
- Integration with Smart Devices:
    Sync with devices like Fitbit or Apple Health for automatic sleep and exercise logging.
- Potential Challenges
    Motivating Users: Ensuring the gamification (plant growth) feels rewarding and engaging enough to encourage consistent use.
    Tracking Health Metrics: Simplifying the user input process for sleep and exercise to avoid overwhelming users.
    Plant Visualization: Creating a dynamic, visually appealing growth system without overloading performance.
